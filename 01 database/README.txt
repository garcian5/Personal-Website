Tutorial:
    1. MySQL = a relational database management system
            - one of the most popular database management system
    
    2. CRUD = Create Read Update Delete
    
    3. Relational Database (SQL) & Non-Relational Database (noSQL/not just SQL)
            - SQL = organize data into one or more tables (each table has comlumns and rows, a unique key identifies each row)
            
            - noSQL = organize data is anything but a traditional table (key-value stores, documents (JSON, XML, etc.), graphs, flexible tables)
    
    4. SQL = Structured Query Language 
            - Standardized language for interacting with RDBMS
            - Used to perform CRUD operations, as well as other administrative tasks (user management, secrutiy, backup, etc.)
            - Used to define tables and structures
            - SQL code used on one RDBMS is not always portable to another without modification
            
    5. Database Queries
            - Queries = requests made to the database management system for specific information
            - as the database's structure become more and more complex, it becomes more difficult to get the specific pieces of information we want
            - a google search is a query
